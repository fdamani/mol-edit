TODO:

- we want to show we can optimize in low-resource settings
- two settings
	- transfer from sim > .4 to sim > .6 or sim >.8
		- how many samples in each category?
		- when training for > .4, we want to include samples from > .8
	- two baselines
		- train on sim > .4, then test with >.8 criteria
		- train on sim >.8 and test on >.8



first todo
- copy translate code over to allow translate changes programmatically.
- using already trained model, recreate plots showing logp performance with varying sim levels.
